# Advanced Node.js API

## Description

The `advanced-node` project is a comprehensive Node.js API that simulates a fictitious Facebook login. This project utilizes TypeScript to enhance development with static typing and leverages modern software engineering principles. It demonstrates best practices in Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture, and Design Patterns. Additionally, the project implements SOLID principles, advanced TypeScript features, and Git best practices to ensure a robust and scalable API.

## Features

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Follow a disciplined approach to write tests before implementation.
- **Clean Architecture:** Organize code into layers to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- **Design Patterns:** Implement design patterns correctly to solve common software design problems.
- **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- **TypeScript:** Utilize TypeScript features such as Utility Types, Interfaces, Type Aliases, and Modular Path Resolution.
- **Git Best Practices:** Follow best practices for version control.
